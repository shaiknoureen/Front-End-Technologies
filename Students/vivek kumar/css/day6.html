        arrest drama that played out at the Ghaziabad residence of Zee News anchor Rohit Ranjan this week, speak of
        something similarly chilling, despite their different circumstances and specific contexts — the bar for
        criminalising the press is being pushed lower and lower. The IPC is being weaponised against journalists
        unabashedly, endangering due process and the vital protections it affords to the rights and freedoms of all
        citizens. And while BJP-led ruling establishments have earned themselves a deservedly dismal reputation on this
        count, the vindictiveness is being mimicked on the other side of the political fence. Zubair was arrested by
        Delhi Police that reports to the BJP-ruled Centre for a 2018 tweet that shared a clip from a 1980s.</p>
    <p class="b">film by Hrishikesh Mukherjee — weeks after he flagged now-suspended BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma’s
        remarks on
        the Prophet in a TV debate. Ranjan was whisked away by UP Police on Tuesday morning, leaving the police team
        that swooped in from Chhattisgarh, stranded, days after his show ran a misleading video of Rahul Gandhi, for
        which the channel later apologised. Gandhi’s comments after an attack on his Wayanad office in Kerala were
        linked to the killing of a tailor in Udaipur — FIRs were promptly registered against Ranjan in the
        Congress-ruled states of Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.</p>

    <p class="c">Also Read |Mohammed Zubair’s arrest is an inversion of justice
        It is no mere coincidence that the sections cited in the FIR against Zubair — Sections 153 (A) and 295 (A),
        promoting enmity between different groups, and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings — also
        figure in the FIR against Ranjan. They are part of a spreading pattern, a template for the targeting of not just
        journalists, but also others who ask questions of the state, express opposition or dissent.</p>

    <div class="ex1">Rafael Nadal Parera (Catalan: [rəf(ə)ˈɛl nəˈðal pəˈɾeɾə], Spanish: [rafaˈel naˈðal paˈɾeɾa];[4]
        born 3 June 1986) is a Spanish professional tennis player, currently ranked world No. 4 in singles by the
        Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP).[1] He has been ranked world No. 1 for 209 weeks, and has finished as
        the year-end No. 1 five times. Nadal has won a record 22 Grand Slam men's singles titles, including a record 14
        French Open titles. He has won 92 ATP singles titles, including 36 Masters titles, with 63 of these on clay.
        Nadal's 81 consecutive wins on clay is the longest single-surface win streak in the Open Era.</div><br><br>

    <div class="ex2">Nadal was one of the most successful teenagers in ATP Tour history, reaching No. 2 in the world and
        winning 16 titles before his 20th birthday, including his first French Open and six Masters events. Nadal became
        No. 1 for the first time in 2008 after his first major victory off clay against his rival, the longtime
        top-ranked Roger Federer, in a historic Wimbledon final. He also won an Olympic gold medal that year in singles
        in Beijing. After defeating Novak Djokovic at the 2010 US Open final, then 24-year-old</div><br><br>

    <div class="ex3"> Nadal became the youngest man in the Open Era to achieve the Career Grand Slam, and the first man
        to win three majors on three different surfaces (hard, grass and clay) in the same year (Surface Slam). With his
        Olympic gold medal, he is one of only two men to complete the Career Golden Slam in singles.[b] Nadal is the
        only male player in history to complete the Career Grand Slam and win an Olympic gold medal in both singles and
        doubles.[c]</div><br><br>

    <div class="ex4">Since 2010, Nadal has continued to dominate at the French Open, winning at least four consecutive
        titles twice, while also winning three more US Open titles and another Australian Open title. He surpassed
        Djokovic and Federer's record for the most major men's singles titles at the 2022 Australian Open, and became
        one of four men in history to complete the double Career Grand Slam in singles. Nadal has appeared in the Top 10
        of the ATP rankings every week since April 2005. From 2005 to 2017, Nadal was coached by his uncle Toni Nadal.
