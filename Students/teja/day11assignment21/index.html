        <p>Software Development Services has long been the popular choice of many 
          firms as they not only save time for a specific project or task but
           also allow companies to access more professionals as well as experts 
            at a reasonable cost than in-house development.
             And in the world where mostly everyone has to work remotely from home, Software Development Services has never been more appealing.!</p>

            <h2>Memory Game</h2>
            <p>Javascript can be used to build games and the classic game of memory is one of the best games to build. 
              The memory game consists of a board that shows the back of cards. When a card is clicked, 
              the card turns over and shows a symbol. When a second card is clicked, it also turns over and shows a symbol.
               The player has a few seconds to memorize the position of the symbols before both cards are turned over.
                The player continues to uncover symbols two cards at a time until the symbols match.!</p>

            <h2>Tic Tac Toe</h2>
            <p>The game of tic tac toe has been around for ages and it is still enjoyed by people of all ages. 
              Build the game in Javascript and learn how to organize your code into functions. Start with the 
              logic first and slowly build up the display in HTML. Once you have the core functions of the game working,
               you can elaborate on the HTML and CSS to make the page animated and responsive.!</p>

            <h2>Javascript Tetris</h2>
            <p>Another classic game you can build in Javascript is tetris.
               The playing field consists of a grid and slowly falling polygons.
                The goal is to arrange these polygons in a way that it fills all the squares in the grid.
                 At the start of the game, the grid is empty. An oddly shaped polygon appears and starts falling,
                  a row at a time. The player can choose to rotate it left or right or move it horizontally left or right, 
                  a square at a time.!</p>

            <h2>Maze Game</h2>
            <p>No list is complete without including a game. With Javascript, you can add fun into a boring,
               static web page. Build a maze on a web page and see if you can start at the entrance of the maze 
               and finish off in record time by traversing the maze, a step at a time.
               You can make a maze as simple as you want or as hard as you can. Put a countdown timer
                on it and see if you can beat the time before it reaches zero. Or put a count up timer
                 on it and add time to it until you make it through the maze.!</p>

            <h2>Countdown clock to New years</h2>
            <p>What do you do to ring in the New Year? Blast off fireworks or are you busy partying away? 
              If you say none to the above then build this simple Javascript project and have a little fun.
               Build a countdown clock and watch the seconds tick down to 0:00.
              You can be as simple as you want or as elaborate as you desire but the countdown clock just
               takes the current day and time and performs some date and time calculations to display it in days,
                hours, minutes and seconds.!</p>
